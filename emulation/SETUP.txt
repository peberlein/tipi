== TIPI For Emulation

This bundle allows using js99er.net TI-99/4A emulation
with an emulated Raspberry PI running the TIPI 
peripheral services.

=== Setup

Download and install QEMU:

* https://www.qemu.org/download/#windows

1: Run nfs_tipi_disk.bat to start NFS server
2: Run tipi-qemu.bat to start TIPI emulation

=== NFS is optional

If you want your TIFILES to live in the tipi_disk folder on your
host operating system, run the nfs_tipi_disk.bat. This will start
WinNfsd.exe and export the .\tipi_disk folder as the nfs mount
localhost:/tipi_disk

When the emulation starts up, the default TIPI support programs
TELNET and TIPICFG will be installed into that folder.

If wish to leave the tipi_disk inside the sd_image, do nothing.
That is the default.. you can still use the web ui at localhost:9900 
to manage your TIFILES.

=== SSH

If you don't like the QEMU terminal, you can SSH in via localhost:9922
as the user 'tipi' password 'tipi'

That means you can also use scp and sftp clients to manage files.

=== Shutdown

use good linux shutdown practices:

command line: sudo shutdown now
TIPI web-ui: there is a shutdown item in the left most menu
4A/emulation: CALL TIPI from basic, 'h' to halt the PI

wait a bit... on the QEMU console you'll see an indication that
halt failed. ( that means it is done, but the hardware can't power off )
you can then just close the window.

=== The Bad News

PI.PIO has been reduced so it doesn't fail. It will produce .prn files in 
the PI emulations /tmp directory. However, the PDF conversion just crashes
out.. so this has been disabled. 

== Recognition

Big thanks to PeteE of Atariage for reducing the TIPI hardware to a
web-socket. 

Equally large thanks to Asmusr of Atariage for js99er and the integration work.
